Simon Game developed in JavaScript.

Simon is a game of memory skills. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.

Instructions to play-

1. You are presented with a random series of button presses.
2. Each time you input a series of button presses correctly, you will see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
3. You will hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when you personally press a button.
4. If you press the wrong button, you are notified that you have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind you of the pattern so you can try again.
5. You can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses by looking at the count indicator.
6. If you want to restart, you can hit the restart button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
7. You can play in strict mode where if you get a button press wrong, it notifies you that you have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
8. You can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.
